class ActivatedCarbon_Filter(Converter, Facade):
    r"""Activated carbon filter water treatment unit with two inputs and one output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    electricity_bus: oemof.solph.Bus
        An oemof bus instance where unit is connected to with
        its electricity input.
    water_in_bus: oemof.solph.Bus
        An oemof bus instance where unit is connected to with
        its untreated water input.
    water_out_bus: oemof.solph.Bus
        An oemof bus instance where the unit is connected to with
        its treated water output.
    specific_energy_consumption: float
        Specific electricity demand/consumption in kWh per m³ treated water. Default: 0.07
    efficiency: float
        Share of untreated water that becomes treated water.
        Value between 0 and 1. Default: 0.97
    capacity: numeric
        The water treatment capacity (output side) of the unit.
    carrier_cost: numeric
        Carrier cost for one unit of used input. Default: 0
    capacity_cost: numeric
        Investment costs per unit of output capacity.
        If capacity is not set, this value will be used for optimizing the
        conversion output capacity.
    expandable: boolean or numeric (binary)
        True, if capacity can be expanded within optimization. Default: False.
    lifetime: int (optional)
        Lifetime of the component in years. Necessary for multi-period
        investment optimization.
        Note: Only applicable for a multi-period model. Default: None.
    age : int (optional)
        The initial age of a component (usually given in years);
        once it reaches its lifetime (considering also
        an initial age), the component is forced to 0 (retire/replace).
        Note: Only applicable for a multi-period model. Default: 0.
    fixed_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar) (optional)
        The fixed operational costs associated with a component.
        Note: Only applicable for a multi-period model. Default: None.
    capacity_potential: numeric
        Maximum invest capacity in unit of output capacity. Default: +inf.
    input_parameters: dict (optional)
        Set parameters on the input edge of the conversion unit
         (see oemof.solph for more information on possible parameters)
    output_parameters: dict (optional)
        Set parameters on the output edge of the conversion unit
         (see oemof.solph for more information on possible parameters)
